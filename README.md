# VASTAVIK
Developed a web-based AI platform to detect deepfake medical images (X-rays, MRIs) using CNN-based models. Integrated  model inference via Flask API and implemented Grad-CAM for explainability. Designed user roles (Admin, Radiologist,  Researcher) and ensured responsive UI with secure access control and image uploads.
